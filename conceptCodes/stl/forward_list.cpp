/*
It differs from list by the fact that forward list keeps track
 of location of only next element while list keeps track to both next and previous elements,
 thus increasing the storage space required to store each element. 
 The drawback of forward list is that it cannot be iterated backwards and 
 its individual elements cannot be accessed directly.*/

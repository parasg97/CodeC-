LCA BST and BT
1.LCA:Least Common Ancestor
	Can be used for finding the distance b/w two nodes
	Code in concept codes folder
2.Level order traversal:
	Use queue

3.Note: Inorder traversal gives output in increasing order

3.AVL
4.Red Black Tree
In notes(only theory is sufficient)

5.Diameter of BT
6.Diameter of N-Ary Tree


5.Insertion in a tree level order BT
6.find height of tree
7.check if a given array represent preorder traversal
8.construct tree from preorder and inorder
9.dist b/w two nodes of BT
10.diameter of BT
11.binary index tree
12.segment tree
